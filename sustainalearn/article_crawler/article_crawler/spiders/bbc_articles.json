And nowhere is plastic more of a headache than the oceans. While litter picking on land is fairly straightforward, once plastic gets into the deep ocean it is a nightmare to remove. Plastic has even been found in the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, 11,000m below the surface. An estimated 8 million metric tonnes of plastic waste enters the world\u2019s oceans every year \u2013 where it stays forever.", "More than just an eyesore and a worry, this trash can be deadly to wildlife across the globe: bags, bottle caps, pen shafts and more are routinely found in the stomachs of dead seabirds, turtles, fish and even whales. In November 2018, a sperm whale washed up dead on the shores of Indonesia with bottles, bags, flip flops and even 115 cups in its stomach.", "Because plastic was explicitly designed to stay intact forever, it doesn\u2019t disappear, even when we can\u2019t see it. Plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, finally becoming \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that can be ingested by plankton and other tiny organisms which are then eaten by larger creatures sending those tiny plastic particles onwards and upwards through the foodchain \u2013 including humans.", "As we are faced with the seemingly impossible task of cleaning up our plastic mess, there is one solution that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked: the old fashioned plastic pick up. A number of inventors and entrepreneurs are taking on the challenge at scale.", "The first place to start is the world\u2019s harbours and bays \u2013 especially in urban areas, where most oceanic plastic pollution starts. It\u2019s estimated more than 90 per cent of the plastic in seas gets there through just 10 of the world\u2019s major rivers. In Japan, officials are starting to experiment with huge nets over sewer pipe outlets, which appears to be having some success \u2013 but there\u2019s still all the trash in the world\u2019s harbours to take care of.", "A team in Australia have designed Seabin, a bucket that uses a solar powered pump to siphon water and trash by bobbing up and down with a cleverly designed lid which prevents fish and other sea life from falling in. The bins have a ravenous appetite. Based on field tests, each bin can gather 1.5 tonnes of waste a year. After years of development, the first commercial Seabin became available for sale in May 2018 \u2013 now they\u2019ve taken over 400 orders from 93 countries across the globe.", "\u201cWe\u2019d love to be able to put ourselves out of business, but the problem won\u2019t go away until we get on top of the source of the problem,\u201d says David Turton of the Seabin Project. \u201cIn the meantime we are just trying to do our best to stop trash from getting into the open ocean.\u201d", "The Seabins aren\u2019t the only way to gather up near-shore plastic waste. Turton is a fan of the WasteShark, autonomous drones modeled on whale sharks that can skitter around a city harbor swallowing up trash. \u201cThere is no one answer that will solve this huge problem \u2013 the global cleanup will need many ideas and many inventions,\u201d says Turton.", "Baltimore\u2019s Mr Trash Wheel, an enormous solar-powered paddle-wheel contraption, hauls trash into the mouth of a googly-eyed, cartoonish waste collector. Its appetite for garbage is formidable: in a single day, Mr Trash Wheel has collected 38,000 lbs of rubbish. With the help of marketing campaign (featuring plush toys made from recycled plastic trash gathered by the wheel), the city of Baltimore has been able to raise the funds to build a second wheel, Professor Trash Wheel. Newport Beach in California, and Honolulu in Hawaii are both on board to build their own wheel.", "Unfortunately, because the wheel collects every kind of waste imaginable, it\u2019s nearly impossible to sort the plastic \u2013 so the trash is burnt in an industrial incinerator to generate energy.", "It\u2019s hard to know just how much plastic is in the open ocean, but scientists estimate we have now dumped more than five trillion pieces of plastic into the ocean. Due to global oceanic currents, much of it has accumulated in five enormous rotating gyres and the largest is the infamous \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch\u201d in the North Pacific Gyre.", "Plastic bags, washing tubs, bubble wrap, toys, trinkets, enormous \u201cghost fishing nets\u201d, entire bathtubs \u2013 you name it, it\u2019s there. Mostly however the plastic debris has been shredded and battered into a Sargasso of unidentifiable shreds and junk which drifts slowly in circles over an enormous patch of 1.6 million km2.", "Though we\u2019ve known about the garbage patch since 1997, nobody has had the courage to fully propose or pursue any solution. A few ideas \u2013 nets, trawls \u2013 have been tossed around, but the sheer scale of the problem has proved intimidating to anyone who dared to think about it.", "In December, a non-profit from the Netherlands called the Ocean Cleanup \u2013 led by a determined 27-year-old inventor \u2013 launched what can only be described as one of the most ambitious environmental projects in human history. The device consists of a 600m long floating tube, called a \u201cfloater\u201d, about 1m in diameter, with a 3m \u201cskirt\u201d dangling below it into the sea. Once dragged out to sea, the long tube \u2013 arranged in a U-shape \u2013 is designed to passively gather plastic into the centre through the differential speed of the plastic trash compared to the much heavier floater.

Eventually they hope to deploy 60 systems, which they believe could remove 50 per cent of the trash in the Pacific every five years.", "Unfortunately, The Ocean Cleanup has hit a snag since launch: in the first four weeks after deployment in November, System 001 wasn\u2019t gathering as much plastic debris into the void of the U shape as well as expected \u2013 trash would drift in, but then drift out again. But even worse, a piece of the apparatus broke on December 29 2018.

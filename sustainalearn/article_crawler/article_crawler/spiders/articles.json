And nowhere is plastic more of a headache than the oceans. While litter picking on land is fairly straightforward, once plastic gets into the deep ocean it is a nightmare to remove. Plastic has even been found in the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, 11,000m below the surface. An estimated 8 million metric tonnes of plastic waste enters the world\u2019s oceans every year \u2013 where it stays forever.", "More than just an eyesore and a worry, this trash can be deadly to wildlife across the globe: bags, bottle caps, pen shafts and more are routinely found in the stomachs of dead seabirds, turtles, fish and even whales. In November 2018, a sperm whale washed up dead on the shores of Indonesia with bottles, bags, flip flops and even 115 cups in its stomach.", "Because plastic was explicitly designed to stay intact forever, it doesn\u2019t disappear, even when we can\u2019t see it. Plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, finally becoming \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that can be ingested by plankton and other tiny organisms which are then eaten by larger creatures sending those tiny plastic particles onwards and upwards through the foodchain \u2013 including humans.", "As we are faced with the seemingly impossible task of cleaning up our plastic mess, there is one solution that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked: the old fashioned plastic pick up. A number of inventors and entrepreneurs are taking on the challenge at scale.", "Cleaning harbours of plastic", "The first place to start is the world\u2019s harbours and bays \u2013 especially in urban areas, where most oceanic plastic pollution starts. It\u2019s estimated more than 90 per cent of the plastic in seas gets there through just 10 of the world\u2019s major rivers. In Japan, officials are starting to experiment with huge nets over sewer pipe outlets, which appears to be having some success \u2013 but there\u2019s still all the trash in the world\u2019s harbours to take care of.", "A team in Australia have designed Seabin, a bucket that uses a solar powered pump to siphon water and trash by bobbing up and down with a cleverly designed lid which prevents fish and other sea life from falling in. The bins have a ravenous appetite. Based on field tests, each bin can gather 1.5 tonnes of waste a year. After years of development, the first commercial Seabin became available for sale in May 2018 \u2013 now they\u2019ve taken over 400 orders from 93 countries across the globe.", "\u201cWe\u2019d love to be able to put ourselves out of business, but the problem won\u2019t go away until we get on top of the source of the problem,\u201d says David Turton of the Seabin Project. \u201cIn the meantime we are just trying to do our best to stop trash from getting into the open ocean.\u201d", "The Seabins aren\u2019t the only way to gather up near-shore plastic waste. Turton is a fan of the WasteShark, autonomous drones modeled on whale sharks that can skitter around a city harbor swallowing up trash. \u201cThere is no one answer that will solve this huge problem \u2013 the global cleanup will need many ideas and many inventions,\u201d says Turton.", "Baltimore\u2019s Mr Trash Wheel, an enormous solar-powered paddle-wheel contraption, hauls trash into the mouth of a googly-eyed, cartoonish waste collector. Its appetite for garbage is formidable: in a single day, Mr Trash Wheel has collected 38,000 lbs of rubbish. With the help of marketing campaign (featuring plush toys made from recycled plastic trash gathered by the wheel), the city of Baltimore has been able to raise the funds to build a second wheel, Professor Trash Wheel. Newport Beach in California, and Honolulu in Hawaii are both on board to build their own wheel.", "Unfortunately, because the wheel collects every kind of waste imaginable, it\u2019s nearly impossible to sort the plastic \u2013 so the trash is burnt in an industrial incinerator to generate energy.", "Plastics in the Big Blue", "It\u2019s hard to know just how much plastic is in the open ocean, but scientists estimate we have now dumped more than five trillion pieces of plastic into the ocean. Due to global oceanic currents, much of it has accumulated in five enormous rotating gyres and the largest is the infamous \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch\u201d in the North Pacific Gyre.", "Plastic bags, washing tubs, bubble wrap, toys, trinkets, enormous \u201cghost fishing nets\u201d, entire bathtubs \u2013 you name it, it\u2019s there. Mostly however the plastic debris has been shredded and battered into a Sargasso of unidentifiable shreds and junk which drifts slowly in circles over an enormous patch of 1.6 million km2.", "Though we\u2019ve known about the garbage patch since 1997, nobody has had the courage to fully propose or pursue any solution. A few ideas \u2013 nets, trawls \u2013 have been tossed around, but the sheer scale of the problem has proved intimidating to anyone who dared to think about it.", "In December, a non-profit from the Netherlands called the Ocean Cleanup \u2013 led by a determined 27-year-old inventor \u2013 launched what can only be described as one of the most ambitious environmental projects in human history. The device consists of a 600m long floating tube, called a \u201cfloater\u201d, about 1m in diameter, with a 3m \u201cskirt\u201d dangling below it into the sea. Once dragged out to sea, the long tube \u2013 arranged in a U-shape \u2013 is designed to passively gather plastic into the centre through the differential speed of the plastic trash compared to the much heavier floater. Or as the team put it: \u201cCreate a coastline where there are none.\u201d Boats will periodically gather up trash from within the zone inside the floater.", "\u201cThe main advantage is that there are no moving parts \u2013 in engine-powered boats, 99 per cent of the maintenance is devoted to the control room to upkeep complex machinery,\u201d says Boyen Slat, inventor of the system and founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cWe aren\u2019t burdened by any of that \u2013 the goal is to make the system flexible enough to follow the waves.\u201d", "Autonomous, energy neutral (solar panels provide power to wifi enabled GPS systems) and scalable, the current system - known as System 001, nicknamed \u201cWilson\u201d \u2013 is the first prototype to be deployed to the Pacific, building on testing and prototyping conducted over five years of tests in the North Sea in Europe with 67 different designs, each building on the last. Eventually they hope to deploy 60 systems, which they believe could remove 50 per cent of the trash in the Pacific every five years.", "Unfortunately, The Ocean Cleanup has hit a snag since launch: in the first four weeks after deployment in November, System 001 wasn\u2019t gathering as much plastic debris into the void of the U shape as well as expected \u2013 trash would drift in, but then drift out again. But even worse, a piece of the apparatus broke on December 29 2018. Crew discovered that one of the tow heads, together with an 18m piece of floater pipe with two stabilizer frames was drifting away from the rest of System 001.", "As of March 2019, the entire system is being docked in Hawaii for repairs and modification, and the team expect to bring it back to the garbage patch in a few months.", "\u201cTo be clear, we realise that setbacks like this are inevitable when pioneering new technology at a rapid pace. Because this is a beta system, we were expecting these sorts of things,\u201d says Rachel Richardson, Communications Strategy Officer. \u201cThe plane didn\u2019t fly on its first attempt, and the space shuttle didn\u2019t succeed on its first attempt. This technology is designed for a really difficult place \u2013 like air or space travel, the ocean is huge and really far away.\u201d", "It is fair to compare gathering up all the plastic trash in the seas to landing a man on the moon \u2013 and in all likelihood, it\u2019s going to be much harder, given the size and the scale of the problem.", "\u201cThere is no reason not to try,\u201d says Slat.", "Featured image by The Ocean Clean Up"], "url": "https://www.bbcearth.com/news/elbow-grease-and-tech-fighting-the-plastic-crisis"}

The invasion of Ukraine underpinned Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and emphatically showed that the diversification of the energy supply chain is crucial for energy security.\u00a0", "Currently, the major political issue for Europe is the provision of adequate amounts of energy at an affordable price for all citizens, as renewable energy sources (RES) are not enough to meet demand. The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas. That is why European leaders, in their effort to secure adequate energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for consumers, have seen an alternative for low-cost energy in these energy production sources, by exploiting the existing infrastructure and knowledge around them.", "On 31 December 2021, the European Commission, following an expert opinion, sent to the governments of the EU member states a draft supplementary-delegated regulation on the EU taxonomy (the EU\u2019s new green investment rulebook), which also included nuclear energy and natural gas, giving them a four-month margin for consultation.

No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

Producers and consumers alike are being urged to consider whether their actions align with the sustainable principles of a circular economy - a model of production and consumption based on sharing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials for as long as possible, in order to extend the life-cycle of products and minimise waste.\u00a0", "Currently, only 8.6% of the world\u2019s economy is successfully circular and there are still 91 billion tonnes of materials being wasted each year. Research undertaken by SAP and the World Economic Forum revealed that 4.9 billion people (61% of the world\u2019s population) lack access to waste management or recycling infrastructure. It\u2019s therefore more critical than ever for businesses to put sustainability at the top of their agendas.\u00a0", "With sustainability a top priority, net-zero practices must become central to companies\u2019 end-to-end operations.

Jamieson explained that the first step is to collect and use data to understand the environmental impact of decisions made along the supply chain. SAP focuses on three key areas for this:\u00a0", "Eliminating waste to prevent environmental destruction.", "Circulating materials within the supply chain for as long as possible.", "Driving regenerative business via end-to-end operational insight, interweaving consumer decisions throughout.", "To achieve these goals, businesses must engage with technological innovations that provide a fuller picture of their impact along the supply chain.\u00a0", "Sensors and ever-improving internet connectivity allow companies to collect data at every checkpoint, from the status of raw materials to the location of finished goods. Similarly, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) allow companies to gather advanced data that promotes efficiency along the supply chain \u2013 whether that\u2019s altering transportation routes to speed-up delivery or exchanging single-use materials in favour of reusable ones.", "\u201cTo deliver a circular economy, we first need to measure it,\u201d says Jamieson. \u201cWe need to understand the recycled content in materials and in products. We need to understand whether those things are reusable, compostable, whether they\u2019re sourced from fossil-based sources, and what the CO2 content is.\u201d", "A study by Capgemini revealed that 41% of companies still have no plans to implement sustainable product design.

The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas.

Rather, it may be time to suggest a third explanation: the pupil has understood the lesson perfectly \u2013 or as much of it as they are ever going to be willing to \u2013 and is just playing dumb because it is in their interests to do so.

Several generations made a choice, in full knowledge of the likely consequences, to inflict entirely unnecessary suffering upon future generations.", "Reading the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report to determine the extent of the suffering we have chosen provides causes for both comfort and anguish. While there is no certainty and no guarantees, the best and worst-case scenarios of socio-economic pathways look increasingly unlikely. We probably will have ancestors, but those ancestors will probably curse us. Mostly one is struck by the monstrous unfairness of it all: while some impacts of climate change will be felt by all, mostly it will be vulnerable communities in the Global South \u2013 those whose historic emissions are lowest \u2013 who will pay the price for the actions of those who will be relatively well protected from consequence.", "Anger is an understandable response to all of this.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years. It is the power and the potential of this challenge that keeps me working with businesses on the SDGs."], "url": "https://sdg-action.org/the-business-case-for-the-sdgs-what-will-the-tipping-point-be/", "date": "2022-10-27 00:00:00"}

Producers and consumers alike are being urged to consider whether their actions align with the sustainable principles of a circular economy - a model of production and consumption based on sharing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials for as long as possible, in order to extend the life-cycle of products and minimise waste.\u00a0", "Currently, only 8.6% of the world\u2019s economy is successfully circular and there are still 91 billion tonnes of materials being wasted each year. Research undertaken by SAP and the World Economic Forum revealed that 4.9 billion people (61% of the world\u2019s population) lack access to waste management or recycling infrastructure. It\u2019s therefore more critical than ever for businesses to put sustainability at the top of their agendas.\u00a0", "With sustainability a top priority, net-zero practices must become central to companies\u2019 end-to-end operations. From design to consumption, companies should be striving for zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality ESG goals at every stage of the supply chain.\u00a0", "Speaking at BizClik\u2019s Sustainability LIVE event earlier this year, SAP\u2019s Global Head of Circular Economy Solutions, Stephen Jamieson, explained how the company has been helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals for the past 50 years. SAP believes in the importance of a circular model built on reusability and recyclability in the design, sourcing, marketing, production and delivery of goods, if the supply chain is to become truly sustainable.\u00a0", "\u201cWe\u2019re using more resources than the planet can sustainably provide, and half of total global emissions come from the way we use materials,\u201d Jamieson told his live and virtual audience. \u201cShifting to a circular economy means a change in how we design not only products and new materials to eliminate waste, but also new policies, infrastructure and business ecosystems.\u201d", "With globalisation, increased product complexity and heightened consumer demands, businesses continue to face barriers in the shift to a circular economy. Jamieson explained that the first step is to collect and use data to understand the environmental impact of decisions made along the supply chain. SAP focuses on three key areas for this:\u00a0", "Eliminating waste to prevent environmental destruction.", "Circulating materials within the supply chain for as long as possible.", "Driving regenerative business via end-to-end operational insight, interweaving consumer decisions throughout.", "To achieve these goals, businesses must engage with technological innovations that provide a fuller picture of their impact along the supply chain.\u00a0", "Sensors and ever-improving internet connectivity allow companies to collect data at every checkpoint, from the status of raw materials to the location of finished goods. Similarly, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) allow companies to gather advanced data that promotes efficiency along the supply chain \u2013 whether that\u2019s altering transportation routes to speed-up delivery or exchanging single-use materials in favour of reusable ones.", "\u201cTo deliver a circular economy, we first need to measure it,\u201d says Jamieson. \u201cWe need to understand the recycled content in materials and in products. We need to understand whether those things are reusable, compostable, whether they\u2019re sourced from fossil-based sources, and what the CO2 content is.\u201d", "A study by Capgemini revealed that 41% of companies still have no plans to implement sustainable product design. Whereas many businesses have already taken strides in reducing their carbon emissions at all stages of the supply chain, many companies continue to ignore the early stages of product design and the later stages of end-of-life management.\u00a0", "Although the sustainable design of products and packaging can be expensive at first, the transition is vital if companies are to reap the benefits of a circular economy. Once sustainable design had been fully implemented, 73% of companies experienced increased revenue growth alongside a 67% reduction in carbon emissions.", "Jamieson also discussed the complexities underlying sustainable packaging, as well as the need for companies to collect and interpret data to fully understand their environmental impact.\u00a0", "\u201cTake a chocolate box. You have the tray containing the chocolate that sits within the primary packaging and then the secondary packaging around that. Then there\u2019s the tertiary packaging, used for transportation. Being able to understand what materials are used at what point in time in production is an unbelievably complicated task, and the reality is that the data needed is often in disparate systems,\u201d he says.", "\u201cWe want to solve the data problem to provide a view of the renewables in chocolate-box packaging. What\u2019s its recyclability? How compostable is it? What\u2019s the thickness? What\u2019s the weight? Once we understand such things, we can then start to aggregate analytics at a global level and help sustainability managers understand how they\u2019re performing against commitments.\u201d", "Circularity isn\u2019t just a problem for big, international businesses; small to medium-sized businesses also have a part to play. While they might not have access to the same funding or technology as their larger rivals, Jamieson says it\u2019s important that SMEs focus on scalable principles first: \u201cIt\u2019s all about embedding sustainable practices that can be scaled as you grow.\u201d", "As regulations around sustainability continue to evolve, SAP is helping companies make the most of its network-based solutions, like SAP Ariba and SAP Business Network for Logistics.

Said the Finnish company\u2019s CEO Joonas Rauramo: \u201cThe key reason why we wanted to be at COP27 was to bring the message that there are technologies available to solve the problem in industries that are considered \u2018hard to abate\u2019 or impossible to electrify, that there are technologies that can help in solving these challenges.\u201d", "Powering a new kiln", "The company\u2019s RotoDynamic Heater is currently capable of generating temperatures of 650\u00b0C and hopes to reach 1000\u00b0C in time. It does all of this without reliance on combustion but, rather, uses electricity to accelerate air and generate friction and heat, thereby forming a sustainable kiln.", "While this heating process will not completely decarbonize the cement production process \u2013 the chemical process of calcination is vital to production and accounts for up to two-thirds of emissions \u2013 it is certainly a step in the right direction.", "Rauramo sees Coolbrook\u2019s technology as the beginning: \u201cWind and solar felt like they started slowly, but that\u2019s what you see when you have an exponential growth curve. In the beginning it looks like it\u2019s slow but, once things get moving, the change happens really quickly.\u201d"], "url": "https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/building-a-new-kiln-for-sustainable-cement-production", "date": "2022-11-17 00:00:00"}

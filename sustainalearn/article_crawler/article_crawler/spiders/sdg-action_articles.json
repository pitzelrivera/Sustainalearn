In search of missing links, the following topics currently dominate discussion online:\u00a0", "These topics reflect and support key areas for energy decarbonization in the race to net zero, so let\u2019s delve into each.", "Many cities and towns globally are still powered by fossil fuel power plants. To completely and immediately abandon these assets (which account for tens of thousands of gigawatts) may be impossible and wasteful in the short term. The question is: can CCUS be deployed quickly to decarbonize these assets?", "Carbon capture has been in development for the last five decades.

The feedstocks used to produce powerfuels can come from primary fossil fuels (coal, wood, gas, oil) and their derivatives \u2013 including waste such as plastics and used tyres.", "Powerfuels such as green hydrogen and ammonia can help decarbonize sectors that are hard to electrify, such as aviation, maritime transport, and industrial manufacturing processes in steel, cement, and chemicals.", "The production of powerfuels, however, relies on an energy-intensive conversion process, requiring the supply of thousands of gigawatts of extra renewable electricity. Investing in prolonging the fossil fuel lifeline when energy access and energy poverty are yet to be solved can be controversial. A similar moral and practical paradox exists in the food-to-biofuel debate.", "Therefore, the use of powerfuels should prioritize hard-to-abate sectors and be produced from\u00a0waste where possible, thereby yielding the greatest economic, social, and environmental benefits.\u00a0", "With more than 80% of global energy still being supplied by fossil fuels, both CCUS and powerfuels are technologies to help decarbonize\u00a0", " that are hard to electrify, treating effects rather than the root cause. In this context, opportunity costs of alternative options (for example, renewable energy and energy efficiency) should not be neglected in the investment and decision-making processes.", "With that background, let\u2019s focus on clean electricity generation \u2013 that is, renewable energy.\u00a0", "The recent rise in gas and oil prices has seen solar and wind gain greater cost advantages, as well as a heightened role in supporting energy security. But given their intermittency, grid firming capacity and\u00a0grid flexibility need to be enhanced. Energy storage is a mature and key grid firming technology that can help balance the variability of renewable energy to minimize investment requirements on the grid and enhance supply reliability.", "As a primary energy source, renewable electricity needs to be significantly scaled up to achieve the Paris goals. Such a scaling up will also support the growth of the sustainable economy globally, which will help to reduce the need for CCUS and support the production of powerfuels to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sectors. The need for speed will also favor wind and solar, the construction time of which is around one third of that for equivalent hydro, geothermal, and nuclear power generation.", "But how much renewable electricity will we need to decarbonize the electricity grid, industry, transport, and the built environment? IEA\u2019s\u00a0", "\u00a0gives a pathway for rapidly scaling up solar and wind this decade, including a more than tripling of the amount installed annually by 2030 compared with 2020. Rooftop solar and more efficient small-scale wind turbines, such as tulip turbines, could help to achieve net zero at the district and municipality level.

In this context, digitization refers to using smart hardware and software to better gather and utilize data to enable:", "Like electric vehicles and battery storage, demand-side modular technologies (such as battery-to-grid, modular nuclear, and hydrogen or ammonia fuel cells) can potentially be the wildcard technologies. They can improve system efficiency and flexibility, further disrupting the current centralized industry and infrastructure. Aside from technology maturity, the diffusion of these technologies and interventions will require overcoming economic, institutional, and behavioral barriers. This is particularly true in the buildings and transport sectors, as experienced in many parts of the world.", "A Climateworks and ASEAN Centre for Energy study highlighted some of the\u00a0", "\u00a0and net-zero goals.", "These include market distortions and inefficiencies due to fossil fuel subsidies, and inadequate pricing of carbon externalities. There is also a lack of financial incentives and few examples of viable business models to attract renewable energy and energy efficiency investments. In addition, there is a need for greater grid capacity and connections to accommodate more renewable energy and flexibility in the electricity network. Human capacity for action and implementation can also be a significant constraint in determining how fast the energy transition could happen.", "The need for critical minerals and the global supply chain presents another challenge.

It has been exacerbated by the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, which has significant implications for energy security.", "Russia is undoubtedly one of the most important players in the global energy market, along with Saudi Arabia and the United States. The invasion of Ukraine underpinned Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and emphatically showed that the diversification of the energy supply chain is crucial for energy security.\u00a0", "Currently, the major political issue for Europe is the provision of adequate amounts of energy at an affordable price for all citizens, as renewable energy sources (RES) are not enough to meet demand. The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas. That is why European leaders, in their effort to secure adequate energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for consumers, have seen an alternative for low-cost energy in these energy production sources, by exploiting the existing infrastructure and knowledge around them.", "On 31 December 2021, the European Commission, following an expert opinion, sent to the governments of the EU member states a draft supplementary-delegated regulation on the EU taxonomy (the EU\u2019s new green investment rulebook), which also included nuclear energy and natural gas, giving them a four-month margin for consultation. But these technologies are not \u201cgreen.\u201d Natural gas has a great environmental impact, intensifying the effects of climate change, while nuclear energy produces hazardous toxic waste for the ecosystem and health.\u00a0", "The EU taxonomy is a list of sustainable economic activities \u2013 that is, activities that are in line with six specific environmental objectives:\u00a0", "It is a valuable tool for attracting sustainable funding, as it helps companies demonstrate the viability of their projects based on specific criteria, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, marine protection, cyclical economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity protection.\u00a0", "The inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the EU taxonomy has specific conditions regarding compliance with modern technical standards, waste management, disarmament of facilities and their replacement with RES in the future. However, in addition to technical difficulties, these also have high costs.\u00a0", "Nuclear power plants will be considered sustainable only if:", "The sustainable labeling can be extended for another two decades only if there are plans for the safe management of nuclear waste \u2013 but this is difficult and costly.\u00a0", "For natural gas there are two options:\u00a0", "To be licensed, new gas-fired power plants must prove that:\u00a0", "In addition, there must be a formal plan to phase out coal in the country.\u00a0", "From a financial point of view, considering these data in the long run, it would be preferable for Europe to accelerate the promotion of RES, rather than labeling the use of nuclear energy and gas as \u201csustainable\u201d activities, even in a transitional manner. This would have multiple benefits.\u00a0", "First, with existing technology, the unit cost of producing energy from RES is lower than the cost of producing fossil fuels and nuclear energy. This will offset the initial cost of renewable energy installations in the long run.\u00a0", "Second, RES would help achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a goal needed to address the catastrophic consequences of climate change, while natural gas and nuclear power are making things difficult. In addition, the use of RES would make Europe autonomous in energy supply. The current energy crisis, and the crucial role of powerful countries such as Russia and China in shaping the energy market, show how important independence is in the face of geopolitical pressures.\u00a0", "Research can decisively support the energy transition through appropriate transformations. It can suggest effective pathways to turn polluting global energy systems into zero-emission systems by developing RES solutions such as solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, electric vehicles, and so on.

Key will be to design approaches that negotiate trade-offs as we pursue the desired equitable economic and social outcomes, while also ensuring environmental sustainability.", "You can expect, for example, innovations focused on increased resource use efficiency and strengthened ecosystem functions. This means improved water productivity that considers all water users, so strengthening governance across water, energy, food, forests, and biodiversity systems. And we\u2019ll arrive at these goals through a focus on capacity development and partnerships to unlock these cross-sectoral gains.", "As\u00a0decision-makers, governments, and researchers have recognized that food systems are part of a bigger network that also includes land, ecosystems, and water, we are beginning to develop strategies that account for all the ways in which they interact.\u00a0But we have a long way to go to transform these systems to achieve the future we want.", "Fortunately, proven and sustainable solutions exist for achieving both greater food security and reduced emissions.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy.

It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years. It is the power and the potential of this challenge that keeps me working with businesses on the SDGs."], "url": "https://sdg-action.org/the-business-case-for-the-sdgs-what-will-the-tipping-point-be/", "date": "\n            27 October 2022\n          "}

It has been exacerbated by the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, which has significant implications for energy security.", "Russia is undoubtedly one of the most important players in the global energy market, along with Saudi Arabia and the United States. The invasion of Ukraine underpinned Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and emphatically showed that the diversification of the energy supply chain is crucial for energy security.\u00a0", "Currently, the major political issue for Europe is the provision of adequate amounts of energy at an affordable price for all citizens, as renewable energy sources (RES) are not enough to meet demand. The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas. That is why European leaders, in their effort to secure adequate energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for consumers, have seen an alternative for low-cost energy in these energy production sources, by exploiting the existing infrastructure and knowledge around them.", "On 31 December 2021, the European Commission, following an expert opinion, sent to the governments of the EU member states a draft supplementary-delegated regulation on the EU taxonomy (the EU\u2019s new green investment rulebook), which also included nuclear energy and natural gas, giving them a four-month margin for consultation. But these technologies are not \u201cgreen.\u201d Natural gas has a great environmental impact, intensifying the effects of climate change, while nuclear energy produces hazardous toxic waste for the ecosystem and health.\u00a0", "The EU taxonomy is a list of sustainable economic activities \u2013 that is, activities that are in line with six specific environmental objectives:\u00a0", "mitigation of climate change", "adaptation to climate change", "sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources", "transition to a cyclical economy", "prevention and reduction of pollution", "protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems", "It is a valuable tool for attracting sustainable funding, as it helps companies demonstrate the viability of their projects based on specific criteria, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, marine protection, cyclical economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity protection.\u00a0", "The inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the EU taxonomy has specific conditions regarding compliance with modern technical standards, waste management, disarmament of facilities and their replacement with RES in the future.

This would have multiple benefits.\u00a0", "First, with existing technology, the unit cost of producing energy from RES is lower than the cost of producing fossil fuels and nuclear energy. This will offset the initial cost of renewable energy installations in the long run.\u00a0", "Second, RES would help achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a goal needed to address the catastrophic consequences of climate change, while natural gas and nuclear power are making things difficult. In addition, the use of RES would make Europe autonomous in energy supply. The current energy crisis, and the crucial role of powerful countries such as Russia and China in shaping the energy market, show how important independence is in the face of geopolitical pressures.\u00a0", "Research can decisively support the energy transition through appropriate transformations. It can suggest effective pathways to turn polluting global energy systems into zero-emission systems by developing RES solutions such as solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, electric vehicles, and so on.

Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3.

Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

The invasion of Ukraine underpinned Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and emphatically showed that the diversification of the energy supply chain is crucial for energy security.\u00a0", "Currently, the major political issue for Europe is the provision of adequate amounts of energy at an affordable price for all citizens, as renewable energy sources (RES) are not enough to meet demand. The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas. That is why European leaders, in their effort to secure adequate energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for consumers, have seen an alternative for low-cost energy in these energy production sources, by exploiting the existing infrastructure and knowledge around them.", "On 31 December 2021, the European Commission, following an expert opinion, sent to the governments of the EU member states a draft supplementary-delegated regulation on the EU taxonomy (the EU\u2019s new green investment rulebook), which also included nuclear energy and natural gas, giving them a four-month margin for consultation. But these technologies are not \u201cgreen.\u201d Natural gas has a great environmental impact, intensifying the effects of climate change, while nuclear energy produces hazardous toxic waste for the ecosystem and health.\u00a0", "The EU taxonomy is a list of sustainable economic activities \u2013 that is, activities that are in line with six specific environmental objectives:\u00a0", "mitigation of climate change", "adaptation to climate change", "sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources", "transition to a cyclical economy", "prevention and reduction of pollution", "protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems", "It is a valuable tool for attracting sustainable funding, as it helps companies demonstrate the viability of their projects based on specific criteria, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, marine protection, cyclical economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity protection.\u00a0", "The inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the EU taxonomy has specific conditions regarding compliance with modern technical standards, waste management, disarmament of facilities and their replacement with RES in the future.

This would have multiple benefits.\u00a0", "First, with existing technology, the unit cost of producing energy from RES is lower than the cost of producing fossil fuels and nuclear energy. This will offset the initial cost of renewable energy installations in the long run.\u00a0", "Second, RES would help achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a goal needed to address the catastrophic consequences of climate change, while natural gas and nuclear power are making things difficult. In addition, the use of RES would make Europe autonomous in energy supply. The current energy crisis, and the crucial role of powerful countries such as Russia and China in shaping the energy market, show how important independence is in the face of geopolitical pressures.\u00a0", "Research can decisively support the energy transition through appropriate transformations. It can suggest effective pathways to turn polluting global energy systems into zero-emission systems by developing RES solutions such as solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, electric vehicles, and so on.

While there is no certainty and no guarantees, the best and worst-case scenarios of socio-economic pathways look increasingly unlikely. We probably will have ancestors, but those ancestors will probably curse us. Mostly one is struck by the monstrous unfairness of it all: while some impacts of climate change will be felt by all, mostly it will be vulnerable communities in the Global South \u2013 those whose historic emissions are lowest \u2013 who will pay the price for the actions of those who will be relatively well protected from consequence.", "Anger is an understandable response to all of this.

", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

Today\u2019s economy offers countless options for consumption, so to consume sustainably is not at all a straightforward task.\u00a0", "For policymakers, it is essential to understand the drivers of consumption impacts. In multiple studies, income is identified as the most relevant driver of consumption impacts (", ";\u00a0", ";\u00a0", "; see also Figure 1).

Per capita footprints generally tend to decrease with household size, but this trend is less pronounced for high-income households (", ";\u00a0", ";\u00a0", ").", "Households in dense urban areas in higher-income countries tend to have lower impacts due to less land-based mobility impacts (shorter distances to travel, more availability of public transport) and smaller apartments (Baiocchi et al., 2010;\u00a0", ";\u00a0", ";\u00a0", "). While it is difficult (or less popular) for policymakers to influence income and household size, urban densification can be influenced by urban development policies. However, the impact of location on consumption impacts is less evident than that of income and household size.", "Some studies also try to cluster consumer groups into archetypes, which by trend have smaller or larger environmental impacts. Such studies may help to develop targeted incentives or other political measures to lower the environmental impacts of particularly impactful households.\u00a0", "For example, a Swiss study (", ") shows that the\u00a0household group having the least per capita environmental footprint is young parents with small children, as they tend to have low-mobility impacts, low apartment area per person, and eat a balanced diet at home (Figure 2). Those who have a high footprint\u00a0include:", "relatively well-off couples close to retirement age that live in over-dimensioned houses and spend much of their free time traveling\u00a0", "young unmarried couples with high incomes who tend to travel and eat out a lot", "Studies like this demonstrate that lifestyle \u2013 affected by income, age group, household size, and other factors \u2013 has direct implications on our footprint. But\u00a0this is not everything. These studies also tell us\u00a0that there are consumers that diverge from the general patterns. For example, research in Switzerland (", ") shows that low-impact households with comparably high income also exist. They tend to consume less mobility, live in houses with \u201cgreen heating systems\u201d (like heat pumps), and generally consume high-quality (higher priced) goods. Such households potentially serve as a model for others.", "Life cycle assessment studies show that housing, mobility, and food are the most relevant consumption areas for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (for example,\u00a0", ";\u00a0", "; see also Figure 1). For water stress and biodiversity loss (through land use or eutrophication, where water becomes progressively enriched with minerals and nutrients), food is the dominant consumption area (", "; see also Figure 1).

Probably. But not necessarily.", "This is because rebound effects may offset some of the environmental gains. Assume, for example, that a consumer reduces food waste to lower their environmental footprint and therefore needs to buy less food. This is good. But it may also save the consumer some money that they can spend elsewhere. This is usually referred to as the \u201crebound effect,\u201d where a reduction in consumption (aimed at reducing the environmental impact) does not achieve its goal fully, because monetary or time savings induce further consumption and, hence, environmental impacts. For example, a UK study (", ") shows that money saved by avoiding food waste is often spent on other consumption with comparable or even higher impacts. On average, for food waste reduction, approximately 80% of the initial GHG reduction saving is lost due to the impact of such alternative consumption.\u00a0\u00a0", "So, are efforts to cut food waste reduction in vain? Should food continue to be wasted? Of course not. But we need to pay attention to what is done with the saved money or time, and to be aware of the risks of problem-shifting. In the end, it boils down to the question of how consumers spend time and money as a whole: making sure they are not just focusing on improving one consumption area and shifting their footprint from this consumption area to another.", "Being aware of rebound effects is an essential start. In particular, as consumers, we can try to avoid high-impact activities altogether. Why not spend the holidays at a place nearby or, if further away, take more time to travel there by train or bike? Living in a well-insulated apartment close to our place of work reduces mobility and heating demand. Eating high-quality seasonal food with only a few animal products can improve both environmental impact and health. Such actions should preferably be combined and not be \u201ceither or.\u201d", "Consuming less also helps, especially when investing the saved money in activities, projects, and people that contribute to an environmentally friendly society. Renewable energies are a good starting point. Why not install solar panels on the roof or balcony \u2013 maybe together with neighbors? Or, if that\u2019s not possible, perhaps look to buy shares in a bigger local photovoltaic plant run, say, by the city or other investor. In addition, we can support environmentally friendly producers or organizations that foster environmental protection. This may then have a positive influence beyond our own footprint.", "This consumer-centric view should be regarded alongside systemic societal changes in our whole economy. These include transitioning to a renewable energy system and creating a circular economy. We need these to make producing consumer goods more sustainable. But only a joint effort in making both production and consumption more sustainable can make a transition towards a more environmentally friendly future happen.", "Today, we are taught by marketing campaigns that buying more goods and services makes us happier.

According to a German study, 50% of new clothing purchased in Germany is only worn once or twice before it is discarded (", ").

The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years. It is the power and the potential of this challenge that keeps me working with businesses on the SDGs."], "url": "https://sdg-action.org/the-business-case-for-the-sdgs-what-will-the-tipping-point-be/", "date": "\n            27 October 2022\n          "},

Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation.

Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple.

The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

We probably will have ancestors, but those ancestors will probably curse us. Mostly one is struck by the monstrous unfairness of it all: while some impacts of climate change will be felt by all, mostly it will be vulnerable communities in the Global South \u2013 those whose historic emissions are lowest \u2013 who will pay the price for the actions of those who will be relatively well protected from consequence.", "Anger is an understandable response to all of this.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy. Scotland is a good example of this being done within the context of nationwide innovation and development, with the SDGs at the heart of its National Performance Framework.", "Extensive work has been done to embed the SDGs in places where the barrier to adoption is low, and interest is high \u2013 in academia, education, and the charities sector. Business, with its high contribution to global emissions, and its footprint on employment, the economy, and the natural world, should be the designated focus for the next seven years.

The invasion of Ukraine underpinned Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and emphatically showed that the diversification of the energy supply chain is crucial for energy security.\u00a0", "Currently, the major political issue for Europe is the provision of adequate amounts of energy at an affordable price for all citizens, as renewable energy sources (RES) are not enough to meet demand. The uninterrupted supply of energy must be ensured for all at the most affordable price, especially for the most vulnerable parts of society. This presupposes a front against speculative pressures both at the European level with harmonized policies and at the national level, to strike a balance between gas and electricity prices.\u00a0", "In the past five years, nuclear power and natural gas have been the two technologies with the greatest contribution to electricity generation. In 2021, 27% of the EU\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power plants and 17% from natural gas. That is why European leaders, in their effort to secure adequate energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for consumers, have seen an alternative for low-cost energy in these energy production sources, by exploiting the existing infrastructure and knowledge around them.", "On 31 December 2021, the European Commission, following an expert opinion, sent to the governments of the EU member states a draft supplementary-delegated regulation on the EU taxonomy (the EU\u2019s new green investment rulebook), which also included nuclear energy and natural gas, giving them a four-month margin for consultation.

Globally, Google data shows a steady increase in searches for \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d over the past five years. Anecdotally, the number of clients I hear mentioning the SDGs, sometimes very early on in a strategy development process, feels like it is growing month to month. ", "The high-profile Conference of the Parties has certainly helped drive awareness of sustainability issues like the climate crisis. Meanwhile, knowledge of the ins and outs of the 17 SDGs, at both goal and indicator level, has burgeoned dramatically. The 16,000 business signatories of the UN Global Compact have access to online business hubs and tools, as well as local networks linking business with civil society and government.", "But with all the tools available, all the interest demonstrated, and all the genuine passion for this important international framework, there is still significant pace to make up for businesses to be truly aligned with the SDGs. In a world where greenwashing is the newest slur to be levied at business, with companies facing legal action for making green claims that cannot be substantiated, the SDGs seem like the unruly cousin \u2013 an unregulated, opt-in, no-repercussions framework. No one is going to hold a chief financial officer\u2019s feet to the fire if they haven\u2019t achieved the alignment goal they set for SDG 3. At the same time, there is nothing to be lost in demonstrating to investors and other stakeholders that your business is au fait with the goals by placing a roundel on your corporate communications. \u201cRainbow-washing\u201d \u2013 the name for greenwashing when it applies to the SDGs \u2013 is heard in the corporate world more and more frequently, but there are as yet no legal or financial ramifications for doing it.", "Both too open and too closed", "The SDGs are like motherhood and apple pie. Everyone likes the concept: the 17 goals are wide-ranging and horizon-broadening, and they are hard to disagree with. It is difficult to state, at any level of a business, whether you are an intern or the CEO, that you are opposed to ending global hunger. That wouldn\u2019t go down well by the water cooler, or in the global Zoom room. And yet, it is relatively abnormal for companies to engage with the SDGs at a deep operational level \u2013 in a way that engages with business growth, research and development, innovation, transformation, and that fundamental shift needed towards new, greener, more socially oriented, and sustainable economic markets. Instead, businesses tend to pick the SDGs that their operations are closest to. They tie the goals into their already-existent sustainability strategy, and hope their efforts in that direction will naturally have an impact. This is a good start. One would hope that, having linked SDGs into their sustainability frameworks, the goals would naturally feed upwards into a business\u2019s operations.\u00a0", "But it is not so simple. Strategies are nothing without key performance indicators and targets, and getting down to the indicator level of the SDGs is where businesses often find their first hurdle. There are 231 unique indicators that sit underneath the 17", "SDGs, and the way that they are scripted does not always allow business to meaningfully engage.\u00a0", "For an agriculture business which has, in theory, a close relationship to SDG 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture)\u00a0it may be impossible to feel that there is meaningful contribution to be made to any of the indicators, which measure elements like:", "prevalence of undernourishment (2.1.1)", "presence of anaemia in women (2.2.3)", "agricultural export subsidies (2.b.1)", "It is very hard to engage with SDG 17 (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable\u00a0Development) unless you are a government, non-governmental organization, or international finance body. And that is because the SDGs were built through complex, long-form international negotiation and diplomacy with many actors. Businesses were far from the core players, and the outcomes were not designed only to engage them.", "This does not mean we need to start from scratch. While the issues outlined above might feel far from a business\u2019s day-to-day activities at first blush, it is almost certain that such indicators are stored up in their supply chain. Somewhere in those 231 indicators, most businesses should find something to which they can meaningfully contribute. Indeed, firms may find that the exercise helps them to think laterally and holistically. How could a manufacturing business meaningfully contribute to 1.4.1 \u2013 an increase in the proportion of population living in households with access to basic services?\u00a0", "Perhaps, if they were a kitchenware manufacturer, they could donate some of their excess stock to community groups whose basic needs are not currently met. Or they could keep a percentage of goods at low enough costs for such groups to access them on an ongoing basis. Both are potentially exciting outcomes for a business to consider and in doing so in line up with wider thinking about the role of businesses in wider communities, and variations of stakeholder capitalism.\u00a0", "Currently, the former activity \u2013 donating goods \u2013 would likely be characterized under a standalone charitable initiative. The latter activity would form part of a pricing strategy. But neither would involve operational change. Should the prompt from the SDGs really be towards these short-term, initiative-led approaches? Or should it indicate instead more transformative change, supporting firms \u2013 and so, our economies \u2013 to move in a long-term direction, radically shifting their operations to support sustainable development?", "This \u201cinvestigate-the-indicators\u201d methodology is a high-friction, high-investment approach to the SDGs. It involves deeply combing the indicators for something that might not be evident, and may not be operationally important. Will the kitchenware manufacturer find indicators across multiple SDGs? Will they be able to respond to the interconnected manner within which the SDGs should be realized? And are there genuine contributions to be made to the achieving of the SDGs that firms may be able to provide, but are not currently captured in existing indicators?", "As a default outcome, then, businesses are often left with top-level alignment, and little room for maneuver underneath. The SDGs at goal level are open enough for any business to argue that they have considered them within their planning. But in their granular, indicator form they are too closed for firms to feel like they can genuinely contribute.\u00a0", "What happens next?", "There are seven years left until 2030, when the clock runs out on the SDGs and we look to the next generation of the framework. In those seven years, I believe we need to be more experimental to draw the power and finance of the private sector into the SDGs\u2019 vision. These experiments would be usefully focused on business operations rather than initiatives, and on long-term transformation rather than short-term impacts.\u00a0", "One experiment could be to promote the hooking of the SDGs into the innovation, research and development, new business, and sales and marketing functions of business, drawing them into the strategic center of business activity. The same approach has proven valuable for the wider sustainability or ESG (environmental, social, and governance) drive within business. How would a new product or service offering be developed if it was to be targeted at SDGs 4 and 9? How would design teams react if they knew the customer demographic particularly valued SDG 7? Using the SDGs to shape out a new business canvas, rather than retrofitting it into existing activities, could lead to transformational outcomes.", "A second experiment here is to develop a secondary set of indicators, diversified from the current suite, that are actionable for the private sector. These should be more open than the current indicators and give specific guidance to different sectors to help them work towards the goals, galvanizing work towards, not just alignment to, the goals. Co-creation with business could lead to peer learnings and deeper buy-in for the SDGs, and gain insight from the business community \u2013 all useful as we look towards 2030.", "A third route could pick up the legal fight. There is a role for the SDGs in state and region-level business legislation, to make the legal risk that accompanies greenwashing real for rainbow-washing too. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, a mandated reporting requirement in the UK from 2022 for companies of a certain size, has shifted climate risk and opportunity to the mainstream, and is an example of where regulation has moved the dial on strategy. Some nations have already embedded the SDGs into investment policy.
